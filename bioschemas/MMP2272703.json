  "description": "Desulfovibrio piezophilus sp. nov. C1TLV30 is able to grow up to 20 MPa. We aim to identifying genomic specificities for adaptation to high pressure by comparing this genome to that of D. vulgaris and using genomics data to identify differentially expressed proteins according to pressure growth conditions. A novel sulfate-reducing bacterium, designated C1TLV30(T), was isolated from wood falls at a depth of 1693 m in the Mediterranean Sea. Cells were motile vibrios (2-4 \u00d7 0.5 \u00b5m). Strain C1TLV30(T) grew at temperatures between 15 and 45 \u00b0C (optimum 30 \u00b0C) and at pH 5.4-8.6 (optimum 7.3). It required NaCl for growth (optimum at 25 g NaCl l(-1)) and tolerated up to 80 g NaCl l(-1). Strain C1TLV30(T) used as energy sources: lactate, fumarate, formate, malate, pyruvate and ethanol. The end products from lactate oxidation were acetate, H(2)S and CO(2) in the presence of sulfate as terminal electron acceptor. Besides sulfate, thiosulfate and sulfite were also used as terminal electron acceptors, but not elemental sulfur, fumarate, nitrate or nitrite. Strain C1TLV30(T) possessed desulfoviridin and was piezophilic, growing optimally at 10 MPa (range 0-30 MPa).",
