  "description": "Thermotoga maritima strain MSB8. This hyperthermophilic organism was originally isolated from a geothermal marine area near Vulcano; Italy. Strain MSB8 is the type strain. It is representative of a very deep branch of eubacteria and a very large portion of the genome; 24% of all ORFs; is similar to archaeal genes; suggesting horizontal gene transfer; a hypothesis supported by the fact that many regions of the chromosome containing these genes have a significantly different composition as compared to the rest of the genome. This organism appears to live in a rich environment as it encodes a large number of transporters; both for import and export; of complex substrates such as carbohydrates; including a type II secretion system that may be used to export extracellular enzymes for degradation of biopolymers.",
