  "description": "Over the past 30 years; countless microorganisms exhibiting various metabolisms and physiologies have been isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. One of the more recent isolates; Aciduliprofundum boonei; is the first true acidophile to be isolated from deep-sea vents and is the sole described isolate of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent Euryarchaeota group 2 (DHVE2). The DHVE2 have been detected at vent sites from around the globe using molecular surveys of 16S rRNA genes and appear to be endemic to the deep-sea. Understanding the metabolism and physiology of this organism through whole genome analysis of A. boonei will allow us to make inferences about the ecology of this unique group. In addition; obtaining a genome sequence of a second member of this group from a geographically distant vent site will allow us to compare these isolates and link differences / similarities to geochemical parameters of the vent fluids.",
