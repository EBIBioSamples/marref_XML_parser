  "description": "Draft genome sequence of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon &quot;Candidatus Nitrosopumilus koreensis&quot; AR1 from Arctic Some lineages of Thaumarchaeota inhabiting various environments, including marine water, freshwater, and hot springs, have been proposed for use as ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) (5, 9, 11). These microbes are capable of using ammonia as an energy source and of performing carbon fixation through the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway (1). But, despite their important contributions to the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle, there remain many unanswered questions on their physiology and ecology. Recently, the genome sequence of \u201cCandidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus\u201d strain SCM1, an ammonia-oxidizing archaeon initially isolated in an aquarium. More recently still, AOA in 78-m-deep marine sediment off Svalbard, the Arctic Circle, were enriched using ammonia as an electron donor (8). One such AOA was identified as \u201cCandidatus Nitrosopumilus koreensis\u201d strain AR1, the genome of which was analyzed in the present study.",
