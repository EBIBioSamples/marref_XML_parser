  "description": "The marine isolate Halomonas sp. R57-5 has a number of biotechnologically-useful features including extra-cellular hydrolytic activities with several substrates and high salt tolerance over a wide range of temperatures. Draft genome sequencing identified genes involved in the biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine; which has applications in food processing and pharmacy; as well as those involved in production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs); which can serve as precursors to bioplastics. Here we present the finished genome sequence of Halomonas sp. R57-5 which will facilitate exploitation of this bacterium; either as a whole-cell production host; or by recombinant expression of its individual enzymes.",
