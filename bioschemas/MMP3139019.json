  "description": "In recent years; representatives of the Bacteroidetes have been increasingly recognized as specialists for the degradation of macromolecules. Formosa constitutes a Bacteroidetes genus within the class Flavobacteria; whose members have been found in marine habitats with high levels of organic matter; such as in association with algae; invertebrates and fecal pellets. Here we report on the generation and analysis of the genome of the Formosa agariphila type strain KMM 3901T \u201a\u00c4\u00ec an isolate from the green algae Acrosiphonia sonderi. F.\u00ac\u2020agariphila is a facultative anaerobe with the capacity for mixed acid fermentation and denitrification. Its genome harbors 129 proteases and 88 glycoside hydrolases; indicating a pronounced specialization on the degradation of proteins; polysaccharides and glycoproteins. 65 of the glycoside hydrolases are organized in at least 13 distinct polysaccharide utilization loci; where they are clustered with TonB-dependent receptors; SusD-like proteins; sensors/transcription factors; transporters and oftentimes sulfatases. These loci play a pivotal role in bacteroidetal polysaccharide biodegradation; and in the case of F.\u00ac\u2020agariphila revealed the capacity to degrade a wide range of algal polysaccharide from green; red and brown algae and thus a strong adaption towards an algae-associated lifestyle.",
